Hey! This is our project Swift Cash ATM Project.

We built a modern web app that simulates how an ATM should work. You can log in, check your balance, and handle transactions like withdrawals and deposits. We also designed some unique features like a denomination exchange for getting change and a cool QR code system for cardless cash withdrawals.

Tech We Used:-

The frontend is built with React, TypeScript, and Vite, and styled with Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui. For our dedicated backend and database, we're using Supabase.

How to Run It
If you want to get this running on your own machine, just follow these steps.

Clone the repo:

git clone https://github.com/vivekkulkarni30/swift-cash-ATM.git

Go into the folder:

cd swift-cash-swing-atm

After that, it should be running live on http://localhost:8080 in your browser.
